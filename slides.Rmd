## What is rOpenSci?

* Presented in David's talk... can I quizz you?

* An organization supporting open science and reproducibility

* Packages and a community

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "400px"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/logo.png")
```

## Onboarding?

* Internally developed packages (Scott Chamberlain, Jeroen Ooms).

* Packages submitted by the community.

Onboarding process: ensuring best practices in the collection of packages.
